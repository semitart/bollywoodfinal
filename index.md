# A Journey Through Indian Dance Costumes

Welcome to the creative aspect of Kayden and Kayla's final Bollywood dance project! Here we sharing our journey of creating crochet representations of traditional Indian dance costume pieces, which are crucial to the entertainment Industry in India. 

## Why Crochet?

Crochet, a process of creating fabric by interlocking loops of yarn with a crochet hook, is a craft that has been passed down through generations. It's a versatile technique that allows for a high level of detail and creativity, making it an ideal medium for our project. 

In choosing to crochet these pieces, we wanted to pay homage to the intricate craftsmanship that goes into traditional Indian dance costumes. Moreover, crochet allowed us to engage with the costumes in a hands-on way, practice a physical skill, and greater appreciate the intricate designs and craftsmanship that go into each piece.
